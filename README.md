The Domesday Duplicator is a LaserDisc capture focused, USB 3.0 based DAQ capable of 40 million samples per second acquisition of analogue RF data at 10-bits resolution, the data being in generic PCM style stream format is ready for [FLAC compression](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode/wiki/RF-Compression-&-Decompression-Guide) or direct use with a wide range of decoders.

Capture is via a easy to use GUI capture application.
